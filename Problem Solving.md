## Problem Solving
1. Can you restate the problem in your own words? (Make sure you understand the question)
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the output that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problems? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
